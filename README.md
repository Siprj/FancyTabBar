# About 

FancyTabBar is small project with objective to create tab-bar similar to 
main tab-bar in Qt Creator. It is possible to get Qt Creators tab-bar from
sources https://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator or already altered version
https://github.com/pcogermany/FancyTabBar but I was afraid of misunderstanding
licence so I created my own replica of FancyTabBar.

make
```
